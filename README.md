Instructions:

- In order to execute the program you have to run the DesktopBluecow.exe at /DesktopBluecow/bin/Release/net5.0-windows/DesktopBluecow.exe

- You need to log in with your credentials from the site, for now not available for google registered users.

- In the field player enter your in-game name without battletag (For example if you are John#123 just enter John)

- When you finish a game, before leaving this screen click on "Get last game" which will get the last game information and then click "Upload Game". 
It's important to not go beyond this screen as after it the game information cannot be recovered and you will have to enter the game manually
